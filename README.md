## Balanceing Robot

**This code is deprecated and non-functional.  A functional and updated version is [here](https://github.com/gdeshazer/BalanceRobot).**

Arduino implementation of a balance bot.  This code was written for an introduction to robotics course at Colorado School of Mines.

Much of this code has been written with refference to Kas's project which can be found [here](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=8871.30).

The accelerometer used with this project is the MPU6050.  Data was collected from the chip via the I2Cdev library and the MPU6050 library.  Both of which can be found [here](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib).

Further documentation for the MPU6050 and the I2Cdevlib can be found [here](http://www.i2cdevlib.com/forums/forum/2-mpu-6050-6-axis-accelerometergyroscope-invensense/).
